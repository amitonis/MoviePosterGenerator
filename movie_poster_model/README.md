## Model description

<p><strong>Please share your creations. I would love to see how you have used the LoRA.</strong></p><p>Weight around 1.0  suits most pictures.</p><p>Please do not distribute this LoRA to other platforms. I will be very cranky if I discover it elsewhere.</p><p>Whilst I would appreciate credit in your images, I am not insisting on it.</p>

## Trigger words

## Download model

Weights for this model are available in Safetensors format.

[Download](/Keltezaa/movie-poster-ce-sdxl-flux/tree/main) them in the Files & versions tab.

from diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image
import torch

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

pipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained('black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev', torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to(device)
pipeline.load_lora_weights('Keltezaa/movie-poster-ce-sdxl-flux', weight_name='MoviePoster03-02_CE_FLUX_128AIT.safetensors')
